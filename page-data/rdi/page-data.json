It also collects and stores information about visitor’s consent decisions together with a history of changes thereof. Moreover, it manage specific user requests closely connected with the users fundamental rights as described within the GDPR, such as requests to access (right-of-access), rectify (right-to-rectification), move (right-to-data-portability) and erase (right-to-be-forgotten) their data ensuring that a user’s selection is remembered and respected."},{"heading":"Smart Technologies","icon":"database-network-bold-red.png","description":"<strong>IoT Device Behaviour Analyzer (DBA)</strong> leverages data deriving from the Big Data ecosystem of a smart environment (home or enterprise) to produce graph models of normal behaviour. These models are compared with the corresponding ones built upon inflowing current (real-time) data in order to detect any anomalies that might be indicative of abnormal behaviour. The characterization of the current behaviour as ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal’ is made through advanced Machine Learning methods providing an intelligent mechanism to automatically detect suspicious (unauthorized) devices connected to an IoT network from traffic data."},{"heading":"Social Media &#x26; Collaborative Systems","icon":"brain-bold-green.png","description":"<strong>Semantic Artificial Intelligence Platform (SAIP)</strong> that aims at the identification of “fake news” coming from various data sources such as social media, websites, fora, etc. targeting vulnerable groups of people and alter the public sentiment of the local communities. The platform spots manipulated content and find untrue claims by analyzing massive amounts of social media sharing patterns. Using Graph technology and advanced Machine Learning algorithms we can also detect the stance of a cluster of related articles found and stored in a Database, towards the whole body of the article."},{"heading":"Safety &#x26; (Cyber)Security","icon":"analytics-bold-blue.png","description":"Data Lineage Platform (DLP) based on Machine Learning and Knowledge Graphs providing enterprises the means to not only store and use data but also to draw connections between them, capturing facts related to people, processes, applications, data and things, and connect those facts with the relationships among them. Knowledge graphs can also capture evidence to evaluate the strengths of these relationships, allowing companies to derive context from data. Enterprises are able to prove their compliance with the GDPR and improve their transparency with regulators due to the undisputable proofs of the personal data flows."}]},{"name":"contact","position":"3","heading":"Get in touch","icon":"weightlifting-bold-green.png","description":"Use the form below to send us a message","showAddress":false,"form":{"title":"","namePlaceholder":"Your full name*","emailPlaceholder":"Your work email*","companyPlaceholder":"Your organisation's name*","jobPlaceholder":"Your job title","messagePlaceholder":"Type your message here*","submitBtnTxt":"Submit"},"address":{"title":"Or drop us a visit","line1":"Rue Chair et Pain 3","line2":"1000 Bruselles","country":"Belgium","email":"hello@thesquaredev.com"}}]}}}
