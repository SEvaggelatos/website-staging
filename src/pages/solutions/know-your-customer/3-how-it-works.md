The Open Banking specification is slated to include data that can be used to complete an identity check, directly from a
user’s bank. This identity information, combined with a source of income analysis offered through Credit Kudos, makes 
Open Banking a powerful tool in the KYC/AML process. Any company that needs to understand sources of wealth, or verify
the identity of an individual as verified by their primary current account can capitalise on Open Banking.

KYC (Know Your Customer) allows financial institutions to verify customers’ personal data, using information from their 
online banking. The KYC output provides different types of personal data in a standardised, unified form. Additional 
information is extrapolated from transaction data about the customer (e.g. geolocation) for more thorough customer 
identification.
