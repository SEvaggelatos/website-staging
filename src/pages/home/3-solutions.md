#
# template*: The page template to use, leave it "default" if not sure
# component*: The React component to use (here is "cards")
# heading: The text that appears in the upper left area of the section
# icon: The icon to accompany the heading
##

# Each H3 header (rows starting with ###) becomes the card's icon
